It is my dissertaion of Seoul Nationa University to explore the relationship between housing poverty and civic participation in Seoul. 
Housing poverty is known as a seious obstacle to social integration. It drives people to be neglectful of community and in the end brings neighborhood dissolution. 
Though housing poverty is such widely discussed in terms of social integration, however, we Korea have a tendency to connect housing poverty with something economical. 
A few efforts do exist to see the problem something social, but such efforts seem to describe the poverty as a tragedy of individuals, not of community. 
Therefore, it is necessary to further housing poverty in the eyes of social integration in Korea, which is the ultimate goal of this disseration.
